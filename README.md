Transport Ticket Management System
===

The Transport Ticket Management System, or TTMS for short, is a system for purchasing and cancellation of tickets for public transport such as trains or buses. 
It is possible to search for a route between specified stations and reserve a seat if such an option is available.
The TTMS is written using Java 17, Maven, Spring Boot, and Hibernate; a stack often used in enterprise applications. 
This repo contains only the server side of the application.
